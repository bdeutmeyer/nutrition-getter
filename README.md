What's in this Meal? Group 4

For our project we decided to make a website that finds and displays relevant nutrition data based on ingredients.
The user may search a recipe or paste an ingredients list in the text box. The user may also save their searched recipes to local storage. When My Saved Recipes is clicked the user is brought to a recipe box modal which prompts for recipe info to save. 

On the main HTML page we have 3 sections. The first is for searching a food or ingredient. For this the user has to be kind of specific. They must provide a measurement of the food they want nutritional information for. Otherwise the API cannot do the math to calculate the distribution of macro and micronutrients. The second section spits out the data. We decided the most relevant data and variables to include would be calories, carbohydrates, protein, fat, sugar, cholesterol, fiber and sodium. The last section on the main page provides recipes based upon the search results of the ingredient. The recipes you enjoy section includes calorie count as well as a save recipe button. Once the "save recipe" button is clicked, it populates a modal in the center of the page that allows the user to edit the recipe info, title and saves the website link to the recipe. The "my saved recipes" tab in the navigation bar brings the user to the saved recipes page. There, all the recipes are listed in order from which they were input. In the left-hand corner there exists a button that populates the modal once again, this time it allows users to input their own info. This gets displayed on the page in the same way as the other recipes that were searched using the site.
